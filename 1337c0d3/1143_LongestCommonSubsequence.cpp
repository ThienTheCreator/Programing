/* 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there
is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters
(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Example 2:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Example 3:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 
Constraints:

1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

Couldn't solve it. The solution was easy to understand but it was difficult to come up with in the
middle of solving it. Create a 2d array based on the word size. If char are equal then fill in the
cell with the value of upper left cell plus 1. If the char aren't equal based on the column and row
then take the max of the left or top cell.
