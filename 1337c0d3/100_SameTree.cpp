/* 100. Same Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the
same value.

Example 1:

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104

        if(p && q && p->val == q->val){
            return isSameTree(p->left,q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};

/* Note

The solution has the base case where when p and q is NULL then it is true. When p and q is not NULL
we want to check if the values are equal then make a recursive call on the left and right child.

The was also a solution by satyakam which reduced some lines of code:
https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/discuss/32685/Here's-a-C%2B%2B-recursion-solution-in-minimal-lines-of-code

bool isSameTree(TreeNode *p, TreeNode *q) {
    if (p == NULL || q == NULL) return (p == q);
    return (p->val == q->val && isSameTree(p->left, q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right));
}
