/* 1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points

Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area. 


Example 1:
â€‹
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.

Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

n == points.length
2 <= n <= 105
points[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi <= 109

public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        set<int> s;
        for(int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++){
            s.insert(points[i][0]);
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        int prev = -1;
        for(auto elements: s){
            if(prev != -1){
                res = max(elements-prev,res);
            }
            prev = elements;
        }
        return res;
    }
};

/* Note

This problem statement was confusing. It wanted the largest vertical area,
but it was more like the horizontal distance. I had to look at the discussion
to figure out what to do.
