/* 980. Unique Paths III

You are given an m x n integer array grid where grid[i][j] could be:

1 representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
2 representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
0 representing empty squares we can walk over.
-1 representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.
Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk
over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We have the following two paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We have the following four paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
2. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
3. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
4. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)

Example 3:

Input: grid = [[0,1],[2,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.
Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 20
1 <= m * n <= 20
-1 <= grid[i][j] <= 2
There is exactly one starting cell and one ending cell.

Trying to implement a iterative bfs.
I look at the solution and it looks like we have to do DFS.
